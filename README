
   kalendas - Calendar Calculations

-----------
DESCRIPTION
-----------
  kalendas is a perl script to make calendar calculations. The
  computations are developed on three systems of dating: the Julian
  calendar, the Gregorian calendar and the system of numbering of
  Julian day/date.

------------
REQUIREMENTS
------------
  kalendas requires perl 5 or later. For native language support is
  recommended the module Locale::TextDomain included in the package
  libintl-perl. See DEDEPENDENCES file.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
  1. Many UNIX/Linux distributions have installed Perl; to get your
  location, type into a console
    which perl
  that showed the way (path) of the executable. Similarly platforms
  Windows writing "PATH" in a console MS-DOS or symbol of system
  must also show the location of perl, e.g.: "C:\Perl\bin".

  2. If you want install program from a repository git (as GitHub), first make
  sure have installed GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake, GNU libiconv, GNU gettext and
  Texinfo; in some distros UNIX/Linux some build dependencies are installed by
  default. For build and install the package, run the commands
    $ git clone https://github.com/mikemolina/kalendas.git
    $ cd kalendas
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
    $ make
    $ make install

  3. In UNIX/Linux platforms and like environments, as MSYS for
  Windows operating environment (Woe), extract and install the
  package in the usual form
    $ gunzip -c kalendas-1.0.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
    $ cd kalendas-1.0.0/
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
    $ make
    $ make install
  For improve the encoding characters in Woe/MSYS, rebuild the
  package, running
    $ ./configure
    $ make maintainer-clean
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
    $ make
    $ make install
  For rebuild the package are necessary the tools GNU libiconv,
  GNU gettext, Texinfo and pod2man (included in your Perl distribution).

  In platforms Woe, the installation can be achieved using GNU Make
  (included in the Strawberry Perl distribution).
  Later extract the package, edit woe/Makefile.mgw file for to modify
  the path installation by default and in the symbol's system write
    > cd kalendas-1.0.0
    > copy woe/Makefile.mgw .
    > make -f Makefile.mgw

  4. Later of install, run the perl script
    $ cd /path/to/install/bin
    $ kalendas
  the script can also run directly from the perl interpreter 
    $ perl kalendas
  this option should work correctly from any platform. 

  For the translation of output messages, you can test the perl script
  setting the environment variable LANG according to the idioms included
  in the package. In Woe/MSYS write
    $ env LANGUAGE=es kalendas
  or in the symbol's system
    > set LANG=es
    > kalendas
